    * [Casting an object from a superclass to a subclass requires an explicit cast.](src/main/java/com/trl/theoreticalKnowledge/castingValues/c/c1/Example.java) <br/>
    * [The compiler will not allow casts to unrelated types.](src/main/java/com/trl/theoreticalKnowledge/castingValues/d/d1/Example.java) <br/>
    * [Even when the code compiles without issue, an exception may be thrown at runtime if
        the object being cast is not actually an instance of that class.](src/main/java/com/trl/theoreticalKnowledge/castingValues/e/e1/Example.java)

## Polymorphism.
* The dictionary definition of polymorphism refers to a principle in biology in which an organism or species can have 
  many different forms or stages. This principle can also be applied to object-oriented programming and languages like 
  the Java language. Subclasses of a class can define their own unique behaviors and yet share some of the same 
  functionality of the parent class. <br/>
* Polymorphism is the ability of a single interface to support multiple underlying forms. In Java, this allows multiple 
  types of objects to be passed to a single method or class.  In Java, this allows multiple types of objects to be 
  passed to a single method or class. <br/>
* Types of Polymorphism: <br/>
    * Inheritance. <br/>
    * Generics. <br/>
    * <br/>
    * <br/>










## Referenceable Objects and References.
* We can summarize this principle with the following two rules: <br/>
   * The type of the object determines which properties exist within the object in memory. <br/>
   * The type of the reference to the object determines which methods and variables are accessible to the Java program. <br/>
* An object is an instance of a class created from it using the new keyword. <br/>
* Classes, interfaces, arrays, enumerations and, annotations are the in Java are reference types in Java. Reference 
  variables hold the objects/values of reference types in Java. <br/>

>>       1. Properties are private. <br/>
>>       2. A public no-argument constructor. <br/>
>>       3. Getter for nonâboolean properties begins with "get". <br/>
>>       4. Getters for boolean properties must begin with "is". <br/>
>>       5. Getters for Boolean properties must begin with "get". <br/>
>>       6. Setter methods begin with "set". <br/>
>>       7. The method name must have a prefix of "set", "get", "is" followed by the first letter of the property in 
>>          uppercase and followed by the rest of the property name. <br/>
>>       8. Implements Serializable. <br/>
>>     
>> * Although boolean values use "is" to start their getter method, the same does not apply to instances of the
